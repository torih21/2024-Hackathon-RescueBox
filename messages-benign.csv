Hey - last minute but someone is seeing the apartment at 6pm tonight,picture
I think you have DND until late but I thought id let you know,she sat in this spot on my desk and waited for me to put the bed there for her lol
"Oh crap okay. My room isn't in great shape bc I was half packing today and idk if I made my bed, sorry I should have been more careful about it. Do you think it's okay to show them my room but then also your room as a better example (like, I have a coffee table in my room rn lol)",not in the office today
that's fine I'm sure they'll understand that you're packing,no. I got up early to do homework. And non of my friends are in on Monday
I have been showing my room anyways so it should be good,I sent you a book that's on it's way
"okay cool, I appreciate it!! Sorry about that, I know I'd said I'd keep my room ready",Okay!
no worries,it's out front
also I know you washed the hand towels by the sink - I'll need them bac when you fold them ! Thanks !,"Cool beans!! Going to work from a coffeeshop for some change in scenery, so I'll grab it when I get home!!"
"ofc, if you have any of my towels and stuff in the collection please get them back to me when you can too!",
